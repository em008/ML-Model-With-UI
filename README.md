# ML-Model-With-UI

For this project a neural network regression model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to predict future counts based on data collected. The model architecture has several layers and number of neurons. Regularization techniques like dropout are applied to prevent overfitting. A simple web application is built using Flask that integrates the model.

To run the app locally in a CLI navigate to the directory that contains the `app.py` file. Then run the command `python app.py`. The app will run on this local development [server](http://127.0.0.1:5000) by deafult unless manually changed.
