# ML-Model-With-UI

For this project a neural network regression model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. A simple web application is built using Flask that integrates the model.  


To access the app in an internet browser use this [link](https://em008.github.io/ML-Model-With-UI/).

To run app locally in a CLI navigate to the directory that contains the app.py and index.html files.
Then run the command: `python app.py`. The app will run on this local development [server](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
